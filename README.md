# ML-Iris-database-
This contains a code which helps in predicting the class in iris database. Five algorithms are compared based on their accuracy of how they fit the test data and then the best one is selectde and used for prediction. 
The five algorithms are - Logistic Regression, Decision tree, SVM, LDA, GaussianNB.
We find that the best accuracy is for SVM and then use it for prediction.
